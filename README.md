# fast-audiovae

Fast inference for VoxCPM2's AudioVAE2 decoder, with optimized CPU kernels and optional Apple or NVIDIA GPU execution. Latents `[1, 64, L]` at 25 Hz produce mono audio `[1, 1, 1920*L]` at 48 kHz. Supports full-clip and stateful streaming decoding.

## Run

Use Python 3.11 to 3.13. Install from the release wheels; pip picks the platform automatically:

```sh
python -m pip install fast-audiovae==0.5.0 --find-links https://github.com/plivo-labs/fast-audiovae/releases/expanded_assets/v0.5.0
```

This installs the CPU runtime and kernels without PyTorch or GPU dependencies. The wheel includes the small GPU integration code, but its dependencies are optional.

The refreshed 0.5.0 wheels use build 1. Already installed 0.5.0? Add `--force-reinstall --no-deps` to the install command to refresh the package without reinstalling dependencies.

With uv, use `uv pip install` with the same arguments. The first load downloads the pinned weights and prepares a local cache. Native wheels include the kernels and their CPU dependencies; no compiler or kernel flags are needed.

```python
from fast_audiovae import load

decoder = load()  # Streaming is the default.
with decoder.stream() as stream:
    # Pass only new latents: NumPy float32, shape [1, 64, L].
    audio = stream.decode_chunk(latents)
```

For a complete latent sequence, use `decoder = load(mode="batch")`, then `audio = decoder.decode(latents)`. Both return 48 kHz audio. [Streaming usage and validation](docs/streaming.md).

The loader selects the CPU kernels automatically. Streaming and one inference thread are the defaults. Each latent frame produces 40 ms of audio; pass two frames for 80 ms packets. Use `load(threads=4)` to request four inference threads. The available CPU budget and supported schedules may cap that request; `decoder.info` shows what was selected.

Apple CPUs with SME/SME2 automatically use the faster one-thread streaming kernels. Multiple threads and batch mode retain their existing kernels. Other Apple CPUs retain the compatible native path; unsupported systems use portable ONNX with a fallback message. CPU is always the default device. [Apple update and quality checks](docs/apple-int8.md).

The native wheels include the validated AMD and Intel kernels for one-thread streaming. Older wheels keep their existing kernels. [AMD validation](docs/amd-serving.md) and [Intel validation](docs/intel-serving.md).

Native wheels currently cover Apple ARM on macOS 26.2 or newer and compatible Intel/AMD Linux x86 systems with glibc 2.38 or newer. The loader also checks native library compatibility before using them.

For Apple or NVIDIA GPU support, add the optional `gpu` extra:

```sh
python -m pip install 'fast-audiovae[gpu]==0.5.0' --find-links https://github.com/plivo-labs/fast-audiovae/releases/expanded_assets/v0.5.0
```

The extra adds PyTorch 2.14.x alongside CPU support. CPU remains the default; GPU runs only when you select `load(device="gpu")`. The loader selects Apple MPS or NVIDIA CUDA and prepares the optimized 40/80 ms paths automatically; first compilation takes extra time. NVIDIA requires Linux x86-64, a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build and an Ampere or newer GPU. [Apple GPU validation](docs/apple-gpu.md) and [NVIDIA GPU validation](docs/nvidia-gpu.md).

## Decoder speed

CPU-only causal streaming on Apple M5 Max, using ONNX Runtime 1.30.0. Lower RTF is better; 1.0 is real time. All decoders carry history between calls and need no future latent frames.

Version 0.5.0, one thread, 79 recordings totaling 860 seconds:

| Output chunk | Previous optimized RTF | Updated default RTF | Less decoding time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 40 ms | 0.1693 | **0.1263** | 25.4% |
| 80 ms | 0.1146 | **0.0996** | 13.1% |

These are matched confirmation timings with state validation between calls. They are separate from the earlier three-codec comparison below; Mimi was not rerun in this check. [Protocol and quality](docs/apple-int8.md).

Earlier comparison, before the one-thread update:

| Threads | Output chunk | Base AudioVAE2 RTF | Optimized AudioVAE2 RTF | Pocket Mimi RTF |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 40 ms | 0.7050 | **0.2316** | n/a |
| 1 | 80 ms | 0.4706 | **0.1390** | 0.1019 |
| 4 | 40 ms | 0.2279 | **0.0941** | n/a |
| 4 | 80 ms | 0.1705 | **0.0631** | 0.0357 |

Same three multilingual recordings, two warmups and five measured repetitions per case. The one-thread run had substantial timing drift across all codecs, so these observations do not establish a thread-count speedup or reproduce the historical 0.07122 short-clip result. RTF includes decode calls and flush; loading and encoding are excluded. AudioVAE2 outputs 48 kHz; Pocket continuous Mimi outputs 24 kHz and has an 80 ms minimum frame. [Protocol and results](docs/streaming-baseline.md).

Linux CPU package checks, **one thread**, ONNX Runtime 1.29.0, causal streaming:

| CPU | Output chunk | Accepted reference RTF | Packaged AudioVAE2 RTF |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| AMD EPYC 9654 | 80 ms | 0.1352 | **0.1375** |
| Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 VM | 40 ms | 0.3960 | **0.3941** |
| Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 VM | 80 ms | 0.2652 | **0.2666** |

Short matched package checks on three 1.6-second multilingual prefixes per machine, timing completed `Session.run` calls only. AMD was about 1.7% slower than its accepted reference; Intel differed by about 0.5%. Outputs and checked histories matched the accepted optimized recipes exactly. These are separate sessions from the Apple tables. The later AMD library-lookup fix passed numerical checks without another timing run. [AMD protocol](docs/amd-serving.md) and [Intel protocol](docs/intel-serving.md).

Independent batch decoding on Apple M5 Max, **one CPU thread**, using `load(mode="batch")`:

| Complete input length | Previous AudioVAE2 batch RTF | Updated AudioVAE2 batch RTF | Pocket Mimi batch RTF |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 40 ms | 0.2341 | **0.1051** | n/a |
| 80 ms | 0.2198 | **0.0743** | 0.0486 |
| 960 ms | 0.0715 | **0.0535** | 0.0343 |

Short matched check on three recordings, with two warmups and three measured repetitions. Each batch call decodes its entire input with empty history; 40/80 ms rows are tiny independent inputs, not whole-recording throughput. In this same check, streaming the 960 ms inputs in 80 ms packets gave RTF 0.0763 for AudioVAE2 and 0.0560 for Mimi. These timings come from a different session than the streaming table above. Version 0.4.0 includes the updated batch path. Streaming remains the default. [Batch validation and earlier full-clip results](docs/apple-batch-validation.md).

Apple GPU causal streaming on the same M5 Max, using PyTorch 2.14.0, float32 and one host thread:

| Decoder | Output rate | 40 ms RTF | 80 ms RTF |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Original AudioVAE2 GPU | 48 kHz | 0.1696 | 0.0933 |
| Optimized AudioVAE2 GPU | 48 kHz | **0.0577** | **0.0321** |
| Pocket Mimi GPU | 24 kHz | n/a | 0.0634 |

Short matched check on three 960 ms multilingual segments, with one warmup and two measured repetitions. These are back-to-back stateful streaming calls returning completed CPU-ready audio, with load and compilation excluded. At 80 ms, optimized AudioVAE2 used about half Mimi's decoding time in this check. Paced live-stream latency can differ. Waveform and history checks passed; an additional eight-second continuation passed at both packet sizes. [GPU protocol and results](experiments/apple-gpu-v6/report.md).

Version 0.5.0 build 1 on NVIDIA H100 NVL, causal streaming, FP32, one host thread:

| Output chunk | Previous compiled CUDA RTF | Updated CUDA default RTF | Less decoding time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 40 ms | 0.01623 | **0.01459** | 10.1% |
| 80 ms | 0.00880 | **0.00742** | 15.6% |

All 60 multilingual recordings, totaling 535 seconds, with two matched timing rounds. These are installed-package timings including per-packet safety checks and completed CPU audio, with loading and compilation excluded. The earlier bare-kernel screen measured 0.01337/0.00690; those are not the public API numbers above. [NVIDIA validation](docs/nvidia-gpu.md).

## Reconstruction quality

One-thread, 80 ms streaming on the same 60 FLEURS recordings across ten languages. AudioVAE2 was rescored for the new Apple default; original and Mimi scores are the retained reference results. Higher is better. All metrics use 16 kHz audio; PESQ and STOI compare against the original, while UTMOS and DNSMOS score each recording without a reference.

| Audio | PESQ-WB | STOI | UTMOS22 | DNSMOS P.835 overall | DNSMOS P.808 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Original recordings | Reference | Reference | 2.321 | 2.775 | 3.428 |
| AudioVAE2, Apple CPU default | 3.741 | 0.9360 | 2.257 | 2.766 | 3.403 |
| Pocket Mimi | 2.130 | 0.8074 | 2.517 | 2.894 | 3.339 |

DNSMOS update: the earlier "overall" column was P.835, and its values were confirmed. The table now also shows P.808. Rechecking all saved recordings with Microsoft's pinned scorer confirmed that Mimi leads P.835 overall, while AudioVAE2 leads P.808. [Revalidation details](docs/streaming-baseline.md#dnsmos-revalidation).

The Apple update introduces small numerical differences; its paired quality scores stayed very close to the previous default. [Detailed comparison](docs/apple-int8.md). UTMOS and DNSMOS are predictions, not human ratings. These metrics do not assess frequencies above 8 kHz. Meta DACVAE is excluded because the tested checkpoint requires future frames.
