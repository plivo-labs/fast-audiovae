# Apple batch validation

The batch path reuses the selected Apple FP32 kernels for independent inputs. These checks were performed on a prerelease source checkout using the unchanged v0.3.0 native payload; the batch path subsequently shipped in v0.4.0 and is retained in v0.5.0. They do not replace [streaming qualification](streaming-baseline.md). Ordinary `load()` selects streaming, including [the current one-thread INT8 recipe](apple-int8.md) on supported Apple CPUs; independent calls use `load(mode="batch")`.

The batch graph accepts one complete `[1, 64, L]` input and returns all `1,920 * L` samples at 48 kHz. Each call starts with zero history. It preserves the trained tensors and native kernels, replacing the 26 external history inputs with constants. It does not carry state between calls or prepend latent frames.

## Follow-up with Pocket Mimi

The earlier batch table omitted Mimi and timed only independent 40/80 ms inputs. Those are small complete inputs, not the multi-second whole recordings used by older batch benchmarks. Batch and a fresh streaming call perform similar work at those lengths.

A short follow-up used the same Bengali, English and Spanish recording prefixes for both codecs, one CPU thread, ONNX Runtime 1.30.0, two warmups and three measured repetitions. Methods were interleaved with seeded order. Each value below is the mean of the three per-recording medians. Models, kernels and trained weights were unchanged. Pocket continuous Mimi outputs 24 kHz and accepts one latent per 80 ms; an independent 40 ms input is not supported. AudioVAE2 outputs 48 kHz.

| Complete input | Previous AudioVAE2 batch | Current AudioVAE2 batch | Pocket Mimi batch |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 40 ms | 0.2341 | 0.1051 | n/a |
| 80 ms | 0.2198 | 0.0743 | 0.0486 |
| 960 ms | 0.0715 | 0.0535 | 0.0343 |

For the same 960 ms inputs, carried-history streaming in 80 ms packets measured 0.0763 for AudioVAE2 and 0.0560 for Mimi. Batch reduced time by a median paired **29.83%** and **40.12%**, respectively, winning all nine comparisons for each codec. Current AudioVAE2 batch beat its previous route at every tested length, also winning all nine pairs per length. This establishes no regression for these short one-thread cases; it does not qualify longer inputs or four-thread throughput.

All **150 output checks** passed against stock AudioVAE2 or the exact same full Mimi decoder on the corresponding input, at `atol=1e-5, rtol=1e-4`. Maximum absolute difference was **3.595e-7**. Input bytes, expected output sample counts and all recorded artifacts remained unchanged. The 525 API calls, including references, warmups and streaming flushes, totaled **5.46 seconds**. Session/model setup, external output checks and concatenation were excluded from timing. [Measurements and protocol](../benchmarks/batch/apple-mimi-audit-20260913.json).

The historical **0.02470 AudioVAE2 / 0.02815 Mimi** batch results used **four threads, ONNX Runtime 1.29, and ten complete recordings of 7.68–10.80 seconds each**. Those were corpus-weighted full-clip results, so they cannot be substituted into the 40/80 ms table. [Historical record](../benchmarks/apple-precision/sme2-panels.json).

The current batch route always uses the selected graph. Above two latent frames (80 ms), eight specialized early matrices switch to their general single-threaded BLAS fallback; ten later selected matrices use that BLAS path at all lengths. The previous full graph lets ORT execute those matrix operations. This difference warrants a matched check before claiming four-thread or long-recording performance. It did not cause a measured one-thread regression at 960 ms in this follow-up.

## Matched short measurements

Apple M5 Max, macOS 26.5.1, FP32 and ONNX Runtime 1.30.0 CPU execution. Thread counts are ORT intra-op threads; inter-op and nested BLAS/OpenMP workers are limited to one. Existing custom kernels retain their one-worker policies.

RTF is API time divided by returned audio duration; lower is faster. Each row compares methods from the same run.

| ORT threads | Input | Stock batch | Released batch | New batch | Fresh-stream control |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 40 ms | 0.4782 | 0.3595 | 0.2121 | 0.2094 |
| 1 | 80 ms | 0.4565 | 0.3542 | 0.1340 | 0.1430 |
| 4 | 40 ms | 0.4253 | 0.3194 | 0.2441 | 0.2402 |
| 4 | 80 ms | 0.2995 | 0.1677 | 0.1507 | 0.1626 |

Three fixed speech inputs cover Bengali, English and Spanish. Each method received two warmup groups and five measured groups of five independent calls per input. The table averages the three per-input medians equally. Loading, preparation and external output checks are excluded; API validation and allocation are included. The fresh-stream control also includes stream creation, zero-state initialization, empty flush and close, so these values are not continuous-stream RTF.

The [benchmark record](../benchmarks/batch/apple-20260913.json) retains ranges, paired comparisons and artifact hashes. Variability was visible, and the thread settings ran sequentially. These results do not isolate thread scaling or support comparison with historical continuous-stream numbers.

## Validation scope

At each thread setting, 25 inputs covered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 13 latent frames from speech, expressive audio and encoded silence. All 100 comparisons across the four methods passed against stock full decoding of the exact same short input, using `atol=1e-5, rtol=1e-4`. Maximum absolute difference was **2.135e-6**. Every output retained its expected sample count.

A/B/A repeats were bitwise stable. Empty input, future-prefix checks and two concurrent candidate callers passed; the shared native session serialized those callers. All recorded artifact hashes remained unchanged and the accepted processes exited cleanly.

A separate public API smoke confirmed automatic batch selection at one and four threads, and unchanged default streaming with graph `5918e523…`. The final source suite passed **314 tests and 1,959 subtests**, with a clean exit. No native kernel was edited or rebuilt. No long-corpus benchmark or perceptual-quality scores were rerun for this batch change.
